all things related to generating code for KSP.

There is also the file "PartsLogger.dll". This is a custom KSP mod that makes a txt file with a list of parts that were used for a ship. 

To install:
-put it in Kerbal Space Program\GameData

it puts the data in:
Kerbal Space Program\GameData\SimplePartLogger\PartsList.txt

The lists gets made when you enter flight mode. So not when building the ship.
